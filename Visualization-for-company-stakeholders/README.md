### Project Overview

 **Problem Statement:** You have been hired by the stakeholders of Dream Housing Finance company to help them get visual insights on the company's operations. Using the data visualization techniques you learned, you have to help visualise the data and see if you can help the stakeholders arrive at some inference based on the visual plots.



### Learnings from the project

 learned the use of matplotlib to plot different graphs to repersent the data in more visual way


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 solved questions:
- Company has more 'loan approvals' or 'loan disapprovals'?
- Can one of the company's health factors be its loan status distribution?

- Which is the region with the highest no. of loan approvals? lowest no. of loan approvals?
- Which is the region with the maximum difference between loan approvals and loan rejections?

- Overall which group has asked for higher loan services irrespective of the approval? Graduate or Non-Graduate?
- Which group has had better approval to non-approval ratio? Graduate or Non-Graduate?

- Do Graduate people get approved a higher amount than their Non Graduate counterparts?
- What's the average amount of loan approved for Graduate? for Non-Graduate? Is there a huge difference between the two? 

- Is there a correlation between 'ApplicantIncome' and 'LoanAmount'?(One way to know that is looking at the line formed when you connect the scatter plot dots?)
- Is the 'TotalIncome' better related to the 'LoanAmount' than 'ApplicantIncome'?

by plotting scatter and density plots
